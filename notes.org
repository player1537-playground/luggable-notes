* Executable format
** Called the MZ Executable Format
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable]
** In a wiki format for OS development
   [http://wiki.osdev.org/MZ]
** And in C format, reproduced below with notes
   [http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/exe/]

   #+NAME: MZ Format
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     #define PARAGRAPH = 16
     #define BLOCK 512

     struct EXE {
       unsigned short signature; /* == 0x5a4D */

* Emulating the IBM PC
** 8086tiny
   [http://www.megalith.co.uk/8086tiny/]

   Should be a very good piece of software to use to test everything and get a
   working demo going before we move everything to the luggables.

   #+NAME: build-8086.bash
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     dir=build/8086tiny

     if [ ! -e $dir ]; then
         git clone https://github.com/adriancable/8086tiny $dir
     fi

     cd $dir

     make no_graphics
   #+END_SRC
* Assembling Code
** MASM 16
   Google search for "masm16 download"
   [http://www.masmforum.com/board/index.php?PHPSESSID=786dd40408172108b65a5a36b09c88c0&topic=2689.0]
   [http://www.prashanthpai.com/pesse/mp_lab/8086_Assembler.zip]

   This is the assembler recommended in [1]
* Moving files to the IBM PC
** Plugging the floppy drive in to a different desktop
   One solution is to take another computer and put the IBM PC's floppy drive
   into a different computer, which should be able to read/write to the floppy
   disk, if the BIOS supports it and if we have the right cabling.

   Need a Shugart (which is now called Seagate) connector:
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST-506]
   from here:
   [http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-32-Inch-Universal-Floppy-FDAT/dp/B00066HOX4]
** Get a floppy drive emulator
   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_hardware_emulator]
   If we can get one of these, it will be much easier to move files to and from
   the luggable.
** Just retype everything
   A final alternative is to retype everything, and make a small hex editor,
   similar to HexIt or XVI at
